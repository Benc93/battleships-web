Makers Academy Week 3 Project: Battleships to Web
===========
    
###Briefing
   
This was the third team exercise at Makers Academy where the groups got a little smaller and were a continuation of the previous week's project.  
     
The task for the week was to link the game 'engine' to a user front-end that is hosted online. We forked an existing Battleships game engine in order to get the most out of the week's project instructions as our previous week's efforts were not quite ready to deploy. 
  
###New technologies/techniques
    
+ First use of **Gemfile** using Bundle
+ First attempt at feature testing using **Cucumber** testing framework.
+ First use of **Sinatra** to deploy a web app. 
+ First deployment on to **Heroku**

###Lessons from the week 

This was a big week for finally 'squaring the circle' of what exactly it was we were doing with Ruby on the back end. 

Up until this point it was very hard to visualize what our code actually did in the real world! We'd built a Boris Bike system, and Tube Network and some Battleships game logic but up until this week, but this was the first time it could be viewed on a browser and published to the web. 
     
This rounded out a very busy fortnight for me at Makers Academy, where every single aspect of what we were doing was brand new, and progress was very slow but very rewarding in my understanding of a basic web app. I would love to come back and make some more progress on this Project when time is a little less scarce, even if just to complete the work and smarten up the front end with CSS.
